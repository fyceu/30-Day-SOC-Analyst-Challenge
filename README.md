# 30 Day SOC Analyst Challenge
This repository is part of the 30-Day SOC Analyst Challenge by MyDFIR designed to help aspiring SOC analysts gain hands-on, practical experience in cybersecurity. Throughout the challenge, I will be working on real-world tasks such as setting up and configuring an ELK Stack, detecting and responding to brute force attacks, investigating command and control (C2) activities, and integrating ticketing systems. The challenge is giving me the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) while enhancing my readiness for a SOC analyst role.
